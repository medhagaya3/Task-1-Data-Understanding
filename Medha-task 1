# Task 1: Understanding Dataset & Data Types

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand dataset structure, identify different data types, analyze data quality, and evaluate the **machine learning readiness** of datasets.

This task is completed as part of the **AI & ML Internship**.

## 📊 Datasets Used

### 1. Titanic Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains demographic and travel information of passengers aboard the Titanic and is commonly used for binary classification problems.

**Dataset Source:**  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv

**Target Variable:**  
- `Survived`
### 2. Students Performance Dataset
The Students Performance dataset includes demographic information and academic scores of students, useful for regression and classification tasks.

**Dataset Source:**  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/StudentsPerformance.csv

**Possible Target Variables:**  
- `math score`  
- `reading score`  
- `writing score`

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 Task Workflow

### 1. Dataset Loading
- Datasets were loaded directly from public online sources using Pandas
- Initial rows were inspected to understand structure and features

### 2. Data Type Identification
- Features were classified as:
  - Numerical
  - Categorical
  - Ordinal
  - Binary

### 3. Dataset Inspection
- `df.info()` used to examine data types and missing values
- `df.describe()` used to obtain statistical summaries

### 4. Categorical Data Analysis
- Unique values in categorical columns were examined
- Data distributions and encoding requirements were identified

### 5. Target Variable Identification
- Titanic Dataset: `Survived`
- Students Performance Dataset: Academic scores

### 6. Data Quality Assessment
- Missing values and imbalance identified in the Titanic dataset
- Students Performance dataset found to be clean and well-structured
- Dataset size and suitability for ML evaluated

## 📈 Key Observations

### Titanic Dataset
- Contains missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
- Binary classification problem
- Requires preprocessing before model building

### Students Performance Dataset
- No missing values
- Suitable for regression and classification tasks
- Minimal preprocessing required
